### Programmatic Usage

```python
from stock_trading_agent import StockTradingAgent
import os

# Method 1: Using environment variable
os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY'] = 'your_api_key'
agent = StockTradingAgent()

# Method 2: Pass API key directly
agent = StockTradingAgent(openai_api_key='your_api_key')

# Analyze multiple stocks
stocks = ['NVDA', 'META', 'NFLX']
for symbol in stocks:
    result = agent.analyze_stock(symbol)
    if result['success']:
        print(f"{symbol}: {result['recommendation']} - {result['confidence']} confidence")
        print(f"Analysis: {result['analysis'][:200]}...")
    else:
        print(f"Failed to analyze {symbol}: {result['error']}")
```

recommendations = {}

for stock in tech_stocks:
    result = agent.analyze_stock(stock)

        value = result['current_price'] * shares
        total_value += value
        print(f"{symbol}: {shares} shares @ ${result['current_price']} = ${value:.2f}")
        print(f"  Recommendation: {result['recommendation']} ({result['confidence']})")

print(f"\nTotal Portfolio Value: ${total_value:.2f}")
```

# Analyze and filter by specific criteria
def find_value_stocks(symbols, max_pe=20, min_dividend=0.02):

    for symbol in symbols:
        result = agent.analyze_stock(symbol)
        if result['success']:
            data = result['stock_data']
            pe = data['pe_ratio']
            dividend = data['dividend_yield']
            
            if pe > 0 and pe < max_pe and dividend >= min_dividend:
                value_stocks.append({
                    'symbol': symbol,
                    'pe_ratio': pe,
                    'dividend_yield': dividend * 100,
                    'recommendation': result['recommendation']
                })
    
    return value_stocks

# Find value stocks with P/E < 20 and dividend yield > 2%
value_picks = find_value_stocks(['KO', 'JNJ', 'VZ', 'T', 'IBM'])
for stock in value_picks:
    print(f"{stock['symbol']}: P/E={stock['pe_ratio']:.1f}, "
          f"Dividend={stock['dividend_yield']:.2f}%, "
